## Introduction

**Version control** describes the process of storing and organizing multiple
versions (or copies) of files on your computer. Approaches to version control
range from simple to complex and they can involve the use of both manual and
automatic workflows. Ultimately, the overall goal of version control is to
store and manage multiple versions of the same file(s).

Chances are good that you are already doing some kind of version control
yourself. Most people have a folder/directory somewhere on their computer that
looks something like this:

![](/images/ch02/mac_finder_1.png)

Or perhaps, this:

![](/images/ch02/mac_window_2.png)

This is a rudimentary form of version control where it's completely up to you
to name, save, and keep track of multiple versions of a file. This **filesystem
approach** works minimally well, in that it does provide you with a history of
file versions theoretically organized by their time sequence. But this system
provides no information about how the file has changed from version to version,
why you might have saved a particular version, or specifically how the various
versions are related. This approach is also subject to human error. It's easy
to make a mistake when naming a file version, or to go back and edit a file
without saving a new copy.


### Version Control Systems {#sec-version-control-systems}

A **version control system** (VCS) is software designed to automate version
control. Version control systems originated in the software development
community, where it's common for many people to work on the same file,
sometimes synchronously, amplifying the need to track and understand revisions.
But nearly all types of computer files, not just code, can be tracked using
modern version control systems.

::: {.callout-note title="Historical Note"}
IBMâ€™s OS/360 IEBUPDTE software update tool is widely regarded as the earliest
and most widely adopted precursor to modern, version control systems. Its
release in 1972 of the Source Code Control System (SCCS) package marked the
first, fully fledged system designed specifically for software version control.
:::

It's common for projects to have multiple associated files, so most version
control systems keep track of changes to a **repository**: a collection of
files. Generally, a repository (or repo) is just a directory where you've set
up a version control system to keep track of changes to the contents. A
repository can contain any number of files and subdirectories.

It's also common for people to collaborate on projects, so most version control
systems provide a way to create multiple copies of a repository and share
changes between them. Version control systems can be divided into two
categories based on how they do this:

1. **Centralized** version control systems store the repository and its history
   on a single computer. This computer is usually a **server**, a computer
   connected to the Internet or some other network. Users can check out a copy
   of the repository from the server, make changes, and then check in their
   changes with the server. The server is the sole authority on the
   repository's history. You can think of this as a "hub and spoke" model,
   where the server is the hub and users are the spokes. This is the oldest
   kind of version control system.

2. **Distributed** version control systems treat each copy of the repository as
   an authority on the repository's history, and provide ways to sync changes
   and resolve conflicts between copies. As two different users make changes to
   their copies of the repository, the copies will diverge if both users edit
   the same file. The divergence will remain in place until the two copies are
   synced, at which time the VCS merges the two different versions of the file
   into a single version that reflects the changes made by both users. You can
   think of this as a "network" model (like a social network).

::: {#fig-vcs layout-ncol=2}
![Centralized (hub and spoke) model](/images/ch02/spoke_and_where_cloud.png){}

![Distributed (network) model](/images/ch02/distributed_network.png){}
:::

Centralized VCS provide a very ordered and controlled universe. They ensure
users have access to the most recent version of every file in the repository,
which reduces the potential for conflicting changes to files.

::: {.callout-note title="Historical Note"}
Early centralized version control systems typically required users to check out
individual files or directories rather than entire repositories, and only
allowed one user to check out a given file at time. This prevented conflicting
edits, but made it difficult to work concurrently.
:::

On the other hand, distributed VCS offer greater flexibility. They allow users
to work alone or in small groups, work offline, or work on experimental changes
over an extended period without losing the benefits of version control. These
characteristics facilitate collaborative work. Moreover, a distributed VCS can
be used in a centralized way, where one copy of the repository is treated as
the final authority on the repository's history. This gives users the best of
both worlds, by allowing some to sync directly with each other while others
sync with this authoritative copy.

Today, a distributed VCS, [Git][], is the most popular VCS. Some polls estimate
that it's used by more than 90% of all developers. A few other version control
systems in use today include Mercurial, Subversion, Perforce, and Plastic SCM.
Many document editors, such as Google Docs and Microsoft Word, also have
built-in version control systems. Each of these systems offers a twist on
version control, differing sometimes in the area of user functionality,
sometimes in how they handle things on the back-end, and sometimes both. In
this reader, we'll focus on Git.

[Git]: https://git-scm.com/


### First-time Git Configuration

When you save changes to a repository, Git will automatically annotate the
changes with your name and email. In collaborative projects, these annotations
are important for determining who made which changes. Thus the first time you
use Git, you need to set your name and email.

::: {.callout-tip}
All Git commands begin with `git` and the name of a subcommand.

You can view the documentation for any subcommand by adding `--help` to the
end. For instance, to get help with the `git config` subcommand used in the
next example, run `git config --help`.
:::

To set your name, open a terminal and type:

```sh
git config --global user.name "YOUR_NAME"
```

Replace `YOUR_NAME` with your name or preferred alias. Then press `Enter`. To
set your email, enter:

```sh
git config --global user.email "YOUR_EMAIL"
```

Replace `YOUR_EMAIL` with your preferred public email address. Git is
open-source, community-developed software, so it won't share your email address
with spammers, but your email address *will* be visible on any changes you make
to public repositories.

::: {.callout-tip}
Many developers configure Git to use their real name. This can be beneficial
for ensuring you receive credit for any open-source or academic computing work
you do while building your career.

If you're not comfortable attaching your real name to work you do with Git, a
reasonable alternative is to use an alias you control, such as your GitHub
username. @sec-github explains more about GitHub.

Likewise, if you don't want to attach your primary email address to work you do
with Git, set up a new email address and use that. Avoid making up a fake email
address, as this will make it impossible for people to contact you and might
even allow someone else to take credit for your work.
:::

You can run either of these commands again later to change the name and email
address with which Git annotates your work.

Finally, we suggest that you change the default branch name from `master` to
`main`. You'll learn more about what branches are later, but we advise making
this change now. For too long the computing industry has relied on offensive
terms like "master" and "slave" to describe technology, and changing such terms
is part of a [wider push][sfconservancy] to move away from the framework they
imply. This is a small change, but we at the DataLab believe that, in all
instances, language matters.

[sfconservancy]: https://sfconservancy.org/news/2020/jun/23/gitbranchname/

To make this change, run:

```sh
git config --global init.defaultBranch main
```

## Creating a Repository {#sec-creating-a-repository}

Now that we've established what version control systems are, and you've
configured Git, it's time to create a repository.

Open a terminal and navigate to your home directory:

```sh
cd
```

To **initialize** a repository called `my_first_repository`, enter:

```sh
git init my_first_repository
```

Git will reply with a message like:

```
Initialized empty Git repository in /home/USERNAME/my_first_repository/.git/
```

When you run the `git init` command, Git first checks whether the specified
directory (`my_first_repository/`) exists, and creates it if it doesn't. Then
Git makes the directory a repository by creating a hidden `.git/` subdirectory.
This subdirectory is where Git will store the history of the repository.

::: {.callout-warning}
The `.git/` subdirectory is hidden for a reason: generally, you should let Git
manage its contents. Avoid creating or modifying files and directories inside
`.git/`, as this might break your repository. If you delete `.git/`, your
repository will no longer be a repository---it will just be an ordinary
directory.
:::

::: {.callout-tip}
How many repositories to create is up to you, and depends on how you like to
work, but we recommend that you create a separate repository for each distinct
project.
:::

Now let's check that Git actually recognizes `my_first_repository/` as a
repository. First, navigate to the directory:

```sh
cd my_first_repository/
```

You can use `git status` to check the status of a repository. Try running it
for the new repository:

```sh
git status
```

Since the directory is a repository, Git will respond with output like:

```
On branch main

No commits yet

nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)
```

We'll save branches for a different lesson. Skipping to the second part of the
message, Git says that there are no "commits" yet. A **commit** is a saved
snapshot (or version) of the repository. You'll learn how to make a commit
soon, but right now, it makes sense that there are no commits yet, since you
just created the repository. Finally, in the third part of the message, Git
says that there is nothing to commit. This also makes sense, since we haven't
created any files in the repository yet.

::: {.callout-note}
When Git doesn't recognize a directory as a repository, the output from `git
status` instead looks like:

```
fatal: not a git repository
```
:::


## Adding & Committing Changes {#sec-adding-committing-changes}

Let's create a new file in the repository called `hello.txt`. Open a text
editor (like `nano` or `vim`), enter the following text, and save it as
`hello.txt`:

```
Hello world!
```

Now check the status of the repository again:

```sh
git status
```

```
On branch main

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        hello.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

Git notices the new file, `hello.txt`, and says it's **untracked**, which means
Git doesn't have any history for the file. You just created the file and
haven't committed it yet, so it makes sense that there's no history.

Let's commit `hello.txt` now. The first step is to add the file to Git's
**staging area** (or **index**). The staging area is a virtual space for
preparing commits, where you can select which files or changes to include in
the commit. It might help to imagine the staging area as a box ðŸ“¦ that you're
packing up to store or to send to a friend. The `git add` command adds a file
or set of changes to the box.

::: {.callout-tip}
Putting distinct work in distinct commits makes it easier to inspect (and
occasionally undo) the work. Use `git add` (and its inverse, `git restore
--staged` or `git reset --`) to curate the contents of your commits.
:::

Go ahead and add `hello.txt` to the staging area:

```sh
git add hello.txt
```

Now check the status of the repository again:

```sh
git status
```

```
On branch main

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   hello.txt
```

Now Git reports that `hello.txt` is in the staging area and ready to be
committed.

You can make a commit with the `git commit` command. Enter the command:

```
git commit
```

In response, Git will open a text editor (typically `vim`) with the following
text:

```

# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.
#
# On branch main
#
# Initial commit
#
# Changes to be committed:
#   new file:   hello.txt
#
```

Git will then wait for you to write a **commit message**, a description of what
the commit changes, at the beginning of the text. The first line of the commit
message must be a summary of the commit in 72 characters or less. You can also
optionally follow this with a blank second line and then a longer description
of the commit beginning on the third line.

::: {.callout-note}
Conventionally, the first line of a commit message should be 50 characters or
less, a complete sentence, and written in the imperative mood. For example:

```
Fix typos in the main text.
```

Following conventions makes it easier for others to understand your work, but
there are occasionally situations where doing something else is justified. The
best approach is to talk to your collaborators about specific conventions they
want to follow, and check in with them about exceptions to the conventions.
:::

Edit the first line of the text to look like this:

```
Add first file.
# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.
#
# On branch main
#
# Initial commit
#
# Changes to be committed:
#   new file:   hello.txt
#
```

Finally, you can let Git know that you're done writing the commit message by
saving the text and exiting the text editor.

::: {.callout-note title="Using Vim" collapse="true"}
In Vim, press `i` to enter insert mode and type the commit message.

When you're finished, press `Esc` to return to normal mode, type `:wq` (the
command to write and quit), and press `Enter`.

If you want to cancel the commit instead, press `Esc` to return to normal mode,
type `:q!` (the command to quit without saving), and press `Enter`.
:::

::: {.callout-tip}
If you exit the text editor without saving, Git will cancel the commit.
:::

Git will print some output to confirm that the commit was created:

```
[main (root-commit) 0f5c79d] Add first file.
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 hello.txt
```

Important details in the output include:

* A **hash** that uniquely identifies the commit (`0f5c79d` above, but yours
  will be different)
* The commit message
* The number of files changed
* A list of which files were changed (`hello.txt` in this case)

Run `git status` to see how the output has changed now that you've made a
commit:

```sh
git status
```

```
On branch main
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

Git reports that there's nothing to commit, and that the "working tree" is
clean. The **working tree** consists of the files and directories you actually
have in your repository. The working tree is **clean** if it's identical to the
most recent commit, meaning you haven't changed anything since that commit.

To get more practice making commits, suppose we want to move the file
`hello.txt` to `README.md`, since `README.md` is conventionally the first file
people read when they start working with an unfamiliar repository. Use the `mv`
shell command to move the file:

```sh
mv hello.txt README.md
```

Now check the status of the repository:

```sh
git status
```

```
On branch main
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add/rm <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        deleted:    hello.txt

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        README.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

Git notices that `hello.txt` is gone, and also that there's a new file
`README.md`. Since `README.md` is untracked, Git doesn't recognize that it's
the same file as the old `hello.txt`. Go ahead and add the changes to
`README.md` to the staging area:

```sh
git add README.md
```

Add the changes to `hello.txt` as well:

```sh
git add hello.txt
```

It might seem counterintuitive to add `hello.txt`, since it no longer exists.
What you should keep in mind is that `git add` adds *changes* to the staging
area, *not files,* and moving (or removing) a file is a change to that file.

::: {.callout-important}
Removing/deleting a file is a change to that file, just like creating, editing,
or moving the file.

If you want to delete a file called `FILE` from a repository, first delete the
file, then run `git add FILE` to add the change to the staging area, and
finally run `git commit` to make a commit.

Note that deleted files remain in the repository's history, so it's possible to
restore them later.
:::

Now check the status:

```sh
git status
```

```
On branch main
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        renamed:    hello.txt -> README.md
```

After adding the changes to both files, Git correctly recognizes that the file
was moved/renamed. Go ahead and commit the change with the commit message
`Move hello.txt to README.md.`:

```sh
git commit
```

```
[main 4f57023] Move hello.txt to README.md.
 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 rename hello.txt => README.md (100%)
```

If you check the status now, you'll see that the working tree is once again
clean.

::: {.callout-important}
Remember, saving your work in Git is a two step process:

1. `git add` (for each file with changes you want to save)
2. `git commit`

It's also usually a good idea to run `git status` (and `git diff`, which we'll
see later) before `git commit` to check that you've added the changes you meant
to add to the staging area.
:::

::: {.callout-tip}
You can also make commits without opening a text editor. Use this command:

```sh
git commit -m "COMMIT_MESSAGE"
```

Replace `COMMIT_MESSAGE` with your commit message. You can't provide a detailed
description when you commit this way, so it's only appropriate for small,
simple commits.
:::


## Exploring & Restoring History

Now that you've made some commits, let's take a look at the repository's
history. To view the history of commits to a repository, enter the command:

```sh
git log
```

```
commit 4f5702364c155faa260080671b63177550347ea0 (HEAD -> main)
Author: YOUR_NAME <YOUR_EMAIL>
Date:   Wed Jan 8 14:32:21 2025 -0800

    Move hello.txt to README.md.

commit 0f5c79d0494763a31ade6a2514dd389f3f1eb1b4
Author: YOUR_EMAIL <YOUR_EMAIL>
Date:   Wed Jan 8 13:59:08 2025 -0800

    Add first file.

```

For each commit, the log lists the hash, name and email of the author, the
timestamp, and commit message.

::: {.callout-note}
When a repository has a long history, `git log` will display the commits in a
scrolling window. You can use the up and down arrow keys to scroll, and type
`q` (for quit) to return to the terminal.
:::

Let's make one more commit: we'll add a title to the `README.md` file. Open the
file with a text editor and edit it so that the contents are:

```
# My README

Hello world!
```

When you're finished, save the file. As usual, Git notices that something in
the repository has changed:

```sh
git status
```

```
On branch main
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   README.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

You can view the difference, or **diff** between the working tree and the most
recent commit with `git diff`:

```sh
git diff
```

```
diff --git a/README.md b/README.md
index cd08755..4e3eb18 100644
--- a/README.md
+++ b/README.md
@@ -1 +1,3 @@
+# My README
+
 Hello world!

```

The `git diff` command prints a diff for each file that's been changed. In each
diff, lines added since the last commit are prefixed with `+`, while lines
removed since the last commit are prefixed with `-`. For context, each diff
usually also includes a few lines that didn't change (no prefix). It's a good
idea to check `git diff` before adding files to the staging area, so that you
know what you're adding.

::: {.callout-tip}
If you've changed a lot of files, the output from `git diff` can be
overwhelming. You can use the command `git diff PATH` to view only the changes
to the file or directory at `PATH`.

You can also use `git diff --staged` to see the difference between files in the
staging area and the last commit.

There are many other ways to use `git diff`; check the documentation (`git diff
--help`) to learn more.
:::

Add and commit the changes. After you finish, you should have a third commit in
the repository history (`git log`) that looks something like this:

```
commit e15d8c1355f16c26fe00354855c24bff3626fc1b (HEAD -> main)
Author: YOUR_NAME <YOUR_EMAIL>
Date:   Wed Jan 8 15:35:02 2025 -0800

    Add title.

```

Now suppose you decide you don't like the new title in `README.md`. If you want
to change the title to something new, the best approach is to edit the file and
make a new commit. On the other hand, if you want to restore an earlier version
of the file, manual editing is tedious and error-prone.

Instead, you can use the `git restore --source` command to restore a file to
how it was in a particular commit.

To demonstrate this, let's restore `README.md` to how it was in the commit
before we added a title. First check `git log` to get the commit's hash:

```
commit e15d8c1355f16c26fe00354855c24bff3626fc1b (HEAD -> main)
Author: YOUR_NAME <YOUR_EMAIL>
Date:   Wed Jan 8 15:35:02 2025 -0800

    Add title.

commit 4f5702364c155faa260080671b63177550347ea0
Author: YOUR_NAME <YOUR_EMAIL>
Date:   Wed Jan 8 14:32:21 2025 -0800

    Move hello.txt to README.md.

commit 0f5c79d0494763a31ade6a2514dd389f3f1eb1b4
Author: YOUR_NAME <YOUR_EMAIL>
Date:   Wed Jan 8 13:59:08 2025 -0800

    Add first file.

```

In this example, the hash begins `4f5702`, but it will be different for your
commit.

::: {.callout-tip}
As you can see from `git log`, the full hash for each commit is quite long. For
most Git commands that require a hash, you can just use the first 5-6 digits.
Git will let you know if it needs more digits to disambiguate which commit you
mean.
:::

To restore `README.md` to how it was in commit `4f5702`, run:

```
git restore --source 4f5702 README.md
```

Make sure to replace `4f5702` with the actual hash for your commit.

After running the command, take a look at `README.md` with your text editor.
You should see that it no longer has the title. And if you look at the status
of the repository, you'll see that Git noticed the change:

```sh
git status
```

```
On branch main
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   README.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

As with any other change, you can add and commit this change if you want to
save it in the repository's history.

::: {.callout-warning}
Be careful with `git restore`: when you restore a file, any *uncommitted*
changes you've made to the file will be erased, and there's no undo.

If you just want to see what a file looked like in a previous commit, use `git
show HASH:FILE` instead, where `HASH` is the commit's hash and `FILE` is the
path to the file.
:::

::: {.callout-note}
There are many other ways to use `git restore`. For instance, you can use `git
restore --staged FILE` to remove a file from the staging area. To learn more,
check the documentation (`git restore --help`).
:::

::: {.callout-tip}
If you want to revert/undo an entire commit, use `git revert` rather than `git
restore`. Specifically, run:

```sh
git revert HASH
```

Replace `HASH` with the hash of the commit you want to revert.

Git reverts a commit by creating a new commit, called a **revert commit**, with
changes exactly the opposite of the original: lines that were added get removed
and lines that were removed get added. Because of this, Git will prompt you for
a commit message when you run `git revert`; it's fine to use the default
message.
:::

<!--- TODO
The command to revert a commit is `git revert`. Generally, you should also
provide the command with the hash of the commit you want to revert.

To revert the commit that added the title, run:

```sh
git revert e15d8c
```

Don't forget to replace `e15d8c` with the hash for the commit you made (you can
find this in `git log`). Git reverts a commit by creating a new commit, called
a **revert commit**, with changes exactly the opposite of the original: lines
that were added get removed and lines that were removed get added. When you run
`git revert`, Git creates the revert commit and then opens a text editor for a
commit message as usual. In this case, however, Git also automatically fills in
the commit message:

```
Revert "Add title."

This reverts commit e15d8c1355f16c26fe00354855c24bff3626fc1b.

# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.
#
# On branch main
# Changes to be committed:
#	modified:   README.md
#
```

You can edit the commit message if you want, but it's also perfectly fine to
accept the default message. As usual, save and quit when you're finished. If
you inspect `README.md` with a text editor, you'll see that the title is gone,
and if you examine `git log`, you'll see that there are now four commits in the
repository's history.

## GitHub {#sec-github}

Up to this point, you've only used Git to work with a single repository
**local** to your computer. As a distributed VCS
(@sec-version-control-systems), one of Git's major features is that you can
share commits between repositories (or copies of a repository).

From the perspective of your repository, other repositories are remote. Remote
repositories, or **remotes**, are typically stored on some other computer
connected to yours by a network (such as the Internet).

[GitHub][] is a hosting service for Git repositories, much like Google Drive
and Dropbox are hosting services for files. You don't have to use GitHub or
competing services (such as [GitLab][] and [BitBucket][]) in order to use Git,
but doing so provides a convenient way to share, collaborate on, and back up
repositories.

[GitLab]: https://about.gitlab.com/
[BitBucket]: https://bitbucket.org/

We'll use a remote repository hosted on GitHub to demonstrate how to share
commits, but all of the Git commands described will work with any remote
repository.

::: {.callout-important}
Remember that Git and GitHub are different things! Git is a version control
system, while GitHub is a hosting service built around Git.

GitHub also offers an application called [GitHub Desktop][gh-desktop], which
allows users to manage their local repositories with a point-and-click
graphical user interface (GUI).

[gh-desktop]: https://desktop.github.com/

Ultimately, it's a matter of preference whether you use the GUI or stick with
the command line for your own projects, but it's a good idea to first become
proficient at interacting with Git via the command line. The primary reason
for this is that not every computer you use will have GitHub Desktop
installed---or even have graphics! Many computing servers offer command
line-only access, and if you ever want to use Git repositories on these
machines, you'll need to do so without GitHub Desktop.

### Making an Account

To use GitHub, you need to make a (free) account. Go to [GitHub][] and click
"Sign Up" in the top-right corner of the page. This should take you to a form,
which asks you to enter a username, email address, and password. After you've
entered in this information (and completed a quick CAPTCHA), GitHub will make
you an account. Then, the site will prompt you to complete an optional survey.
Fill it out, or scroll to the bottom to skip it.

Either way, you'll need to then verify your email address. Go to your inbox and
look for an email from GitHub. Click the "Verify email address" button. Doing
so will take you to your profile, where, if you'd like, you can add a few
details about yourself.

You now have a GitHub account! ðŸŽ‰


### Connecting to GitHub with SSH

To connect to GitHub from the command line, you must have a GitHub account and
a way to **authenticate**, or establish your identity (prove that you are who
you say you are). GitHub requires authentication as a security measure, so that
individuals and teams can control who has access to their repositories.

You can establish your identity with an **SSH key**, a kind of cryptographic
key. An SSH key consists of two separate key files:

* A **public key** file which can be used to encrypt data. The public key is
  meant to be freely shared, so that people (or servers) can encrypt data they
  want to securely send to you.
* A **private key** file which can be used to decrypt data that was encrypted
  with the associated public key. The private key is meant for you alone, so
  that only you can decrypt and use data that people send to you. *Never* share
  your private key with *anyone* else.

SSH keys are much more secure than passwords, which is one reason why GitHub
uses them for authentication.

::: {.callout-note}
SSH stands for **secure shell protocol**, a protocol for communication between
two computers. The "secure" in secure shell means that all messages sent
between the computers are encrypted. This makes it practically impossible for a
third party to see what's being sent.

Git uses SSH to connect GitHub. Git can also use SSH to connect to other
servers hosting repositories.
:::

GitHub provides [detailed documentation][gh-ssh] about how to create an SSH key
and add the public key to your GitHub account. Work through the following
sections of the documentation to set up SSH key authentication with GitHub:

* [Checking for existing SSH keys][gh-check]
* [Generating a new SSH key and adding it to the ssh-agent][gh-generate]
* [Adding a new SSH key to your GitHub account][gh-add]
* [Testing your SSH connection][gh-test]

## Sharing a Repository {#sec-sharing-a-repository}

With a GitHub account and SSH key set up, you're ready to upload your first
shared repository to GitHub.

To get started, open a terminal and navigate to your home directory:

```sh
cd
```

Initialize a new Git repository called `USERNAME_first_shared_repo` (replace
`USERNAME` with your GitHub username):

```sh
git init USERNAME_first_shared_repo
```

In the repository, use a text editor to create a `README.md` file with contents
`Hello world!`. It should look something like this:

![](/images/ch02/hello_world.png)

Commit `README.md` and write a descriptive commit message like `Add a README."

So far so good! These steps should be familiar from @sec-creating-a-repository
and @sec-adding-committing-changes. But now it's time to do something new: we
need to set up a repository on GitHub where we can **push**, or send, commits
from the local repository.

Open a web browser and go to [GitHub][]. Make sure you're logged in, then click
the "+" button in the upper-right corner and select the "New repository"
option. You'll be taken to a page like this:

![(click image to enlarge)](/images/ch02/gh_new_repository.png){
  fig-align="center"
  style="max-height: 40em"
  .lightbox
}

The page asks for several details about the new repository:

* A name for the repository
* A short (1-2 sentence) description of what's in the repository
* Whether the repository should be **public** (viewable by anyone) or
  **private** (viewable only by you and those you grant access)
* Whether the repository should be initalized with:
  - A README file, to describe your project to others.
  - A .gitignore file, to tell Git to ignore specific files or directories.
  - A license, to governs the use or redistribution of your files

For this example, give the repository the same name as the one you just created
on your computer (`USERNAME_first_shared_repo`, replacing `USERNAME` with your
GitHub username). Leave the description blank and make sure the repository is
public. Because you already initialized the repository locally, leave all of
the initialization options unchecked. It should look something like this:

![(click image to enlarge)](/images/ch02/gh_new_repository_filled.png){
  fig-align="center"
  style="max-height: 40em"
  .lightbox
}

Once you've filled in the details, click the green "Create repository" button
at the bottom of the page.

GitHub will take you to a new page with "Quick setup" and instructions to
"create a new repository on the command line" or "push an existing repository
from the command line." The page should look something like this:

![(click image to enlarge)](/images/ch02/gh_new_repository_created.png){
  fig-align="center"
  style="max-height: 40em"
  .lightbox
}

Under "Quick setup," click on the "SSH" button, so that the instructions show
how to connect to GitHub with SSH. Since we already created a repository
locally, we need to use the "push an existing repository from the command line"
instructions.

Open a terminal, navigate to the repository you created earlier, and then run
the commands listed on the page. In the screenshot above, these are:

```sh
git remote add origin git@github.com:nick-ulle/nick-ulle_first_shared_repo.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

The first command, `git remote add`, will look slightly different for you,
since your GitHub username is probably not `nick-ulle`. This command tells Git
where to find the repository on GitHub, and to call it `origin`.

The second command, `git branch`, ensures that the default branch is called
`main`.

Finally, the third command, `git push`, pushes the contents of the local
repository to the repository on GitHub (`origin`). You should see some output
like:

```
Enumerating objects: 3, done.
Counting objects: 100% (3/3), done.
Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 1.39 KiB | 1.39 MiB/s, done.
Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0 (from 0)
To github.com:nick-ulle/nick-ulle_first_shared_repo.git
 * [new branch]      main -> main
branch 'main' set up to track 'origin/main'.
```

From now on, when you want to push commits from this repository to GitHub, you
can simply run `git push` (without any arguments).

Now go back to your web browser and refresh the repository's page on GitHub.
You should now see the message in your `README.md` file:

![(click image to enlarge)](/images/ch02/gh_new_repository_pushed.png){
  fig-align="center"
  style="max-height: 40em"
  .lightbox
}

GitHub automatically checks for a README file in your repository and if it
finds one, displays it on the repository's main page. If the README file is
written in [Markdown][], GitHub will even render the formatting.

## Collaborating

::: {.callout-important}
For this this part, you'll need to work with a partner. Take a moment to find a
partner and exchange GitHub usernames. Pay careful attention to the spelling
and capitalization.
:::

You now know how to push commits from a local repository to a remote. The
counterpart to this is **pulling**, or downloading, commits from a remote to a
local repository. In order to learn how to collaborate on repositories and how
to pull commits, let's share the repository from @sec-sharing-a-repository with
a partner. Then they can push a change up to GitHub, and you can pull the
change down to your local repository.

To get started, open a web browser to your repository's main page on GitHub.
Click on the "Settings" button. You'll be taken to a page that looks like this:

![(click image to enlarge)](/images/ch02/gh_repository_settings.png){
  fig-align="center"
  style="max-height: 40em"
  .lightbox
}

On the left side, click on "Collaborators". GitHub might ask you to enter your
password or complete two-factor authentication. Once you've done that, you'll
end up at a page like this:

![(click image to enlarge)](/images/ch02/gh_repository_collaborators.png){
  fig-align="center"
  style="max-height: 40em"
  .lightbox
}

Click on the green "Add people" button near the bottom of the page, then enter
your partner's GitHub username in the popup that appears. Then tell your
partner to check their email (the one they used to register with GitHub) for an
invitation to collaborate on your repository.

After you and your partner have each accepted the invitation to the other's
repository, open the main page of *your partner's repository* in your web
browser. In order to make and commit changes, you first need to
**clone**---download a copy of---their repository to your computer. Click on
the green "Code" button on their repository's main page, select the "Local"
tab, and select "SSH". Then copy the listed URL to your clipboard. It will look
something like this:

```
git@github.com:tshoemaker/tshoemaker_first_shared_repo.git
```

The URL will have your partner's GitHub username rather than `tshoemaker`.

Next, open a terminal and navigate to your home directory:

```sh
cd
```

Then use the `git clone` command to clone a copy of your partner's repository.
You'll need to paste the URL you copied to the end of the command:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:tshoemaker/tshoemaker_first_shared_repo.git
```

```
Cloning into 'tshoemaker_first_shared_repo'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 3, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (3/3), done.
remote: Total 3 (delta 0), reused 3 (delta 0), pack-reused 0 (from 0)
Receiving objects: 100% (3/3), done.
```

Git will display some details about what it cloned from the remote repository.

You should now see a copy of your partner's repository in your home directory.
In the repository, open `README.md` with a text editor, add a short message for
your partner, and save the changes. Then add, commit, and push your changes.

Pause here to check in with your partner. Confirm that they can see the commit
you made on their repository's GitHub page, and check that you can see the
commit they made on your repository's GitHub page. If anything doesn't seem
right, try working through the steps again.

Finally, it's time to pull the commit your partner made to your repository on
GitHub down to your local repository. Open a terminal again and navigate to
*your repository*. Then run `git pull`:

```sh
git pull
```

Git should print output that looks something like this:

```
remote: Enumerating objects: 5, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (5/5), done.
remote: Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0 (from 0)
Unpacking objects: 100% (3/3), 918 bytes | 918.00 KiB/s, done.
From github.com:nick-ulle/nick-ulle_first_shared_repo
   c4bae61..260a2b4  main       -> origin/main
Updating c4bae61..260a2b4
Fast-forward
 README.md | 1 +
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
```

After pulling the commit, inspect the `README.md` file with a text editor to
confirm that it now contains the message from your partner. If it does,
congratulations! You've successfully used Git and GitHub to collaborate with
someone.


## Recap

![](/images/ch02/git_workflow_bg.png)

As shown in the figure above, a typical Git workflow is:

1. Make some changes to the local repository.
2. Stage your changes with `git add`.
3. Commit your changes with `git commit`.
4. Push the changes up to the remote with `git push`.
5. Repeat steps 1-4 until the project is finished.

There are lots of steps in this process, so there are lots of places where it
can go wrong. _Pay attention to error messages_ and search online if you get
stuck. Lots of people use Git, and your question has probably been asked and
answered :)
