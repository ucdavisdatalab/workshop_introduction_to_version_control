# Version Control

## What is Version Control?

**Version control** describes the process of storing and organizing multiple 
versions (or copies) of documents on your computer. Approaches to version control 
range from simple to complex and they can involve the use of both manual and 
automatic workflows. Ultimately, the overall goal of version control is to store 
and manage multiple versions of the same document(s).

Chances are good that you are already doing some kind of version control yourself.
Most people have a folder/directory somewhere on their computer that looks 
something like this:

![A finder window of .docx files labeled with different versions](`r url`)

Or perhaps, this:

![A finder window of .docx files labeled with dates](`r url2`)

This is a rudimentary form of version control that relies completely on a manual 
workflow of saving multiple versions of a file. This system works minimally well, 
in that it provides you with a history of file versions theoretically organized 
by their time sequence. But this **file system method** offers no information 
about how the file has changed from version to version, why you might have saved 
a particular version, or specifically how the various versions are related. This 
self-managed file system approach is more subject to error than software-assisted 
version control systems; it is not uncommon for users to make mistakes when 
naming file versions, or to go back and edit files out of sequence. Software-assisted 
version control systems (VCS) such as Git were designed to solve this problem.

## Software Assisted Version Control

Version control software has its roots in the software development community, where 
it is common for many coders to work on the same file, sometimes synchronously, 
amplifying the need to track and understand revisions. But nearly all types of 
computer files, not just code, can be tracked using modern version control systems. 
IBM's OS/360 IEBUPDTE software update tool is widely regarded as the earliest 
and most widely adopted precursor to modern, version control systems. Its 
release in 1972 of the Source Code Control System (SCCS) package marked the 
first, fully fledged system designed specifically for software version control. 

Today's marketplace offers many options when it comes to choosing a version 
control software system. They include systems such as Git, Visual Source Safe, 
Subversion, Mercurial, CVS, and Plastic SCM, to name a few. Each of these systems 
offers its twist on version control, differing sometimes in the area of user 
functionality, sometimes in how it handles things on the back-end, and sometimes 
both. This tutorial focuses on the Git VCS, but in the sections that follow we 
offer some general information about classes of version control systems to help 
you better understand how Git does what it does and to help you make more informed 
decisions about how to deploy it for you own work.

## Local vs Server-based Version Control

There are two general types of version control systems: **local** and **server** 
(sometimes called cloud) based systems. When working with a **local** version 
control system, all files, metadata, and everything associated with the version 
control system live on your local drive in a universe unto itself. Working locally 
is a perfectly reasonable option for those who work independently (not as part of 
a team), have no need to regularly share their files or file versions, and who 
have robust back-up practices for their local storage drive(s). Working locally 
is also sometimes the only option for projects involving protected data and/or 
proprietary code that cannot be shared. 

**Server-based VCS** utilize software running on your local computer that 
communicates with a remote server (or servers) that store your files and data.
Depending on the system being deployed, files and data may reside exclusively 
on the server and are downloaded to temporary local storage only when a file is 
being actively edited. Or, the system may maintain continuous local and remote 
versions of your files. Server-based systems facilitate team science because 
they allow multiple users to have access to the same files, and all their 
respective versions, via the server. They can also provide an important, non-local 
back-up of your files, protecting you from loss of data should your local 
storage fail. 

**Git is a free server-based version control system that can store files both **
**locally and on a remote server.** While the sections that follow offer a broader 
description of server-based version control, in this workshop we will focus only 
on using Git locally and will not configure the software to communicate with, 
store files on, or otherwise interact with a remote server. DataLab's companion 
[Git for Teams] workshop focuses on using Git with the GitHub cloud service to 
capitalize on Git's distributed version control capabilities.

Server-based version control systems can generally be segmented into two 
distinct categories: 1) Centralized Version Control Systems (Centralized VCS) 
and 2) Distributed Version Control Systems (Distributed VCS). 

## Central Version Control Systems

**Centralized VCS** is the oldest and the predominant form of version control 
architecture worldwide. Centralized VCS implement a "spoke and wheel" architecture 
to provided server-based version control.

![Spoke and wheel diagram showing computers connected to a central cloud](`r url3`)

With the spoke and wheel architecture, the server maintains a centralized 
collection of file versions. Users utilize version control clients to "check-out" 
a file of interest to their local file storage, where they are free to make changes 
to the file. Centralized VCS typically restrict other users from checking out 
editable versions of a file if another user currently has the file checked out. 
Once the user who has checked out the file has finished making changes, they 
"check-in" their new version, which is then stored on the server from where it 
can be retrieved and "checked-out" by another user. Taken together, centralized 
VCS provide a very controlled and ordered universe that ensures file integrity 
and tracking of changes. However, this regulation comes at a cost: namely, it 
it reduces the ease with which multiple users can work simultaneously on the 
same file. 

## Distributed Version Control Systems

**Distributed VCS** are not dependent on a central repository as a means of sharing 
files or tracking versions. Distributed VCS implement a network architecture (as 
opposed to the spoke and wheel of the centralized VCS as pictured above) to allow 
each user to communicate directly with every other user.

![Distributed VCS showing computers connected to each other](`r url4`)

In distributed VCS, each user maintains their own version history of the files 
being tracked, and the VCS software communicates between users to keep the 
various local file systems in sync with each other. With this type of system, 
the local versions of two different users will diverge from each other if both 
users make changes to the file. This divergence will remain in place until the 
local repositories are synced, at which time the VCS stitches (or **merges**) the 
two different versions of the file into a single version that reflects the 
changes made by each individual, and then saves the stitched version of the file 
onto both systems as the current version. Various mechanisms can then be used to 
resolve the conflicts that may arise during this merge process. Distributed VCS 
offer greater flexibility and facilitate collaborative work, but a lack of 
understanding of the sync/merge workflow can cause problems. It is not uncommon 
for a user to forget to sync their local repository with the repositories of 
other team members and, as a result, work for extended periods of time on 
outdated files that don't reflect their teammates and result in work 
inefficiencies and merge challenges. 

## The Best of Both Worlds

An important feature of distributed VCS is that many users and organizations 
choose to include a central server as a node in the distributed network. This 
creates an hybrid universe in which some users will sync directly to each other 
while other users will sync through a central server.

![A hybrid diagram of spoke and wheel VCS and distributed VCS](`r url5`)

Syncing with a cloud-based server provides an extra level of backup for your 
files and also facilitates communication between users. But treating the server 
as just another node on the network (as opposed to a centralized point of control) 
puts the control and flexibility back in the hands of the individual developer. 
For example, in a true centralized VCS, if the server goes down then nobody can 
check files in and out of the server, which means that nobody can work. But in a 
distributed VCS this is not an issue. Users can continue to work on local versions 
and the system will sync any changes when the server becomes available. 
**Git, the focus of this tutorial, is a Distributed VCS.** You can use Git to 
share and sync repositories directly with other users or through a central Git 
server such as GitHub or GitLab.

## How VCS Manage Your Files

Most users think about version control as a process of managing files. For 
example, you might have a directory called `My Project` that holds several files 
related to this project as follows: 

![A finder window with different files related to a project](`r url9`)

One approach to managing changes to the above project files would be to store 
multiple versions of each file as in the figure below for the file `analysis.r`:

![Diagram of analysis.r in a working directory referenced to its versions](`r url10`)

In fact, many VCS do exactly this. They treat each file as the minimum unit of 
data and simply save various versions of each file along with some additional 
information about the version. This approach can work reasonably well. However, 
it has limitations. First, this approach can unnecessarily consume space on the 
local storage device, especially if you are saving many versions of a very large 
file. It also has difficulty dealing with changes in file names, typically 
treating the same file with a new name as a completely new file, thereby breaking 
the chain of version history.

**To combat these issues, good VCS don't actually manage files at all. They **
**manage directories.** Distributed VCS like Git take this alternate approach 
to data storage that is directory, rather than file, based.  

## Graph-Based Data Management

Git (and many other distributed VCS) manage your files as collections of data 
rather than collections of files. Git's primary unit of management is the 
**repository,** or **repo** for short, which is aligned with your computer's 
directory/folder structure. Consider, for example, the following file structure:

![A hierarchical file tree with files and subdirectories](`r url11`)

Here we see a user, Tom's, home directory, which contains three sub directories 
(`Data`, `Thesis`, and `Tools`) and one file (`Notes.txt`). Both the `Data` and 
`Tools` directories contain sub files and/or directories. If Tom wanted to track 
changes to the two files in the `Data` directory, he would first create a Git 
repository by placing the Data directory **under version control.** 

When a repository is created, the Git system writes a collection of *hidden files* 
into the data directory that it uses to store information about all of the data 
that lives under that directory. This includes information about the addition, 
renaming, and deletion of both files and folders as well as information about 
changes to the data contained in the files themselves. Additions, deletions and 
versions of files are tracked and stored not as copies of files, but rather as a 
set of instructions that describes changes made to the underling data and the 
directory structure that describes them.
