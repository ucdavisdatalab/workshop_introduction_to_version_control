# Introduction

This workshop covers the basics of using Git to track and record changes to 
files on your local computer. This allows you to compare versions over time, 
recall earlier changes you made, and effectively collaborate on writing code and 
documents.

This is a **hybrid workshop**. First, read independently work through sections 
1-3 of this reader at your own pace and **ensure that you have successfully **
**installed Git on your local computer**. Next, join us for the live, interactive 
session (details below), during which we will use Git to learn and practice how 
to manage files on our local computers.If you need help troubleshooting your 
installation, drop-in to [DataLab's office hours][] prior to the interactive 
session to ensure that you will be able to follow along on your own machine.

## Interactive Session Information

The workshop includes a live, interactive session to be held via Zoom on 
**Wednesday, February 15, 2021 from 3:00 pm to 5:00 pm**. Zoom login information 
will be sent to all registered participants via email; reach out to 
[datalab-training@ucdavis.edu](mailto:datalab-training@ucdavis.edu) the day prior 
if you received a registration confirmation but have not received your Zoom link.

## About this Tutorial

This online tutorial provides background information that will help participants 
to better understand the concepts introduced during the interactive session. 
It also includes information to help you successfully install Git on your local 
computer, **which must be completed prior to the interactive session**. 
Instructions for installing Git are in section 3.

## Prerequisites

In addition to installing Git, we ask that you:

+ Be familiar with your computer's file navigation system (Finder for Mac, as 
  an example)
+ Have basic facility with using a command line interface, such as Terminal or 
  Git Bash
  
Need to brush up on the command line? The DataLab runs a workshop, "Introduction 
to the Unix Command Line." You can find a reader for that [at this link][]; 
there's also a [recording][] for this session.
