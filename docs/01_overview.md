# Introduction

This workshop covers the basics of using Git to track and record changes to files 
on your local computer. This allows you to compare versions over time, recall 
earlier changes you made, and effectively collaborate on writing code and documents.

This is a **hybrid workshop**. First, independently work through this online 
tutorial at your own pace and **ensure that you have successfully installed Git **
**on your local computer**. Next, join us for the live interactive session 
(details below), during which we will use the Git Version Control System to 
learn and practice how to manage files on our local computer and work with Git. 
If you need help troubleshooting your installation, drop-in to [DataLab's virtual office hours ](https://datalab.ucdavis.edu/office-hours/) prior to the Interactive Session to 
ensure that you will be able to follow along on your own machine.

## Interactive Session Information

The workshop includes a live, interactive session to be held via Zoom on 
**Wednesday, February 24, 2021 from 3:00 pm to 5:00 pm**. Zoom login information 
will be sent to all registered participants via email; reach out to [datalab-training@ucdavis.edu](mailto:datalab-training@ucdavis.edu) the day prior

## About this Tutorial

This online tutorial provides background information that will help participants 
to better understand the concepts introduced during the Interactive Session. 
It also includes information to help you successfully install Git on your local
