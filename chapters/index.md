This workshop covers the fundamentals of using version control for reproducible 
research. Topics covered will include installing the Git versioning control 
software locally, initiating a local Git repository, managing file versions, 
basic branching and merging, and time permitting intermediate topics including 
working with remote repositories and resolving conflicts. At the end of this 
workshop learners should be able to create new repos and begin using Git for 
version control of their individual projects.
