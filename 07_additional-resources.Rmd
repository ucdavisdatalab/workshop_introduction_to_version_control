# Additional Resources

## Git for Teams

Be on the lookout for the [second workshop] in DataLab's Git workshop series, which 
covers the process of using Git to work with teams performing collaborative 
development.

## The Git Book

The [Git Book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) is the definitive Git resource 
and provides an excellent reference for everything that we will cover in the 
interactive session. There is no need to read the book prior to the session, 
but it's a good reference resource to have avaialable as you begin to work 
with Git after the workshop.
