# Git Branching

Branching provides a simple way to maintain multiple, side-by-side versions of 
the files in a repository. Conceptually, branching a repository creates a copy of 
the codebase in its current state that you can work on without affecting the 
primary version from which it was copied. This alows you to work down multiple 
paths without affecting the main (or other) codebase.

To see a list of branches in your repository

```
$ git branch
```

To create a new branch

```
$ git checkout -b hotfix
```

New branches are created of the current working branch. To change branches use

```
$ git checkout <branch name>
```

## Merging Branches

When you merge a branch, git folds any changes that you made to files in an 
identified branch into the current working branch. It also adds any new files. 
When you perform a merge, a new commit will be automatically created to track the 
merge. To merge branches, commit any changes to the branch you want to merge 
(in this example, the "hotfix" branch) then checkout the branch into which you 
want to merge (for example, master), and then execute a merge command.

```
$ git commit -m 'commiting staged files in hotfix branch'
$ git checkout master
$ git merge hotfix

```

## Branching Workflows

![](`r url18`)

## To View an Earlier Commit

```
$ git checkout <commit>
```

To solve Detached Head problem either RESET HEAD as described below or just 
checkout another branch

```
git checkout <branch>
```

To save this older version as a parallel branch execute

```
$ git checkout -b <new_branch_name
```

This will save the older commit as a new branch running parallel to master.
