:::


**Version control** describes the process of storing and organizing multiple
versions (or copies) of files on your computer. Approaches to version control
range from simple to complex and they can involve the use of both manual and
automatic workflows. Ultimately, the overall goal of version control is to
store and manage multiple versions of the same file(s).

Chances are good that you are already doing some kind of version control
yourself. Most people have a folder/directory somewhere on their computer that
looks something like this:

![](/images/mac_finder_1.png)

Or perhaps, this:

![](/images/mac_window_2.png)

This is a rudimentary form of version control where it's completely up to you
to name, save, and keep track of multiple versions of a file. This **filesystem
approach** works minimally well, in that it does provide you with a history of
file versions theoretically organized by their time sequence. But this system
provides no information about how the file has changed from version to version,
why you might have saved a particular version, or specifically how the various
versions are related. This approach is also subject to human error. It's easy
to make a mistake when naming a file version, or to go back and edit a file
without saving a new copy.

### Version Control Systems

A **version control system** (VCS) is software designed to automate version
control. Version control systems originated in the software development
community, where it's common for many people to work on the same file,
sometimes synchronously, amplifying the need to track and understand revisions.
But nearly all types of computer files, not just code, can be tracked using
modern version control systems.

:::{admonition} Historical Note
:class: note
IBMâ€™s OS/360 IEBUPDTE software update tool is widely regarded as the earliest
and most widely adopted precursor to modern, version control systems. Its
release in 1972 of the Source Code Control System (SCCS) package marked the
first, fully fledged system designed specifically for software version control.
:::

It's common for projects to have multiple associated files, so most version
control systems keep track of changes to a **repository**: a collection of
files. Generally, a repository (or repo) is just a directory where you've set
up a version control system to keep track of changes to the contents. A
repository can contain any number of files and subdirectories.

It's also common for people to collaborate on projects, so most version control
systems provide a way to create multiple copies of a repository and share
changes between them. Version control systems can be divided into two
categories based on how they do this:

1. **Centralized** version control systems store the repository and its history
   on a single computer. This computer is usually a **server**, a computer
   connected to the Internet or some other network. Users can check out a copy
   of the repository from the server, make changes, and then check in their
   changes with the server. The server is the sole authority on the
   repository's history. You can think of this as a "hub and spoke" model,
   where the server is the hub and users are the spokes. This is the oldest
   kind of version control system.

2. **Distributed** version control systems treat each copy of the repository as
   an authority on the repository's history, and provide ways to sync changes
   and resolve conflicts between copies. As two different users make changes to
   their copies of the repository, the copies will diverge if both users edit
   the same file. The divergence will remain in place until the two copies are
   synced, at which time the VCS merges the two different versions of the file
   into a single version that reflects the changes made by both users. You can
   think of this as a "network" model (like a social network).

:::::

Centralized VCS provide a very ordered and controlled universe. They ensure
users have access to the most recent version of every file in the repository,
which reduces the potential for conflicting changes to files.

:::{admonition} Historical Note
:class: note
Early centralized version control systems typically required users to check out
individual files or directories rather than entire repositories, and only
allowed one user to check out a given file at time. This prevented conflicting
edits, but made it difficult to work concurrently.
:::

On the other hand, distributed VCS offer greater flexibility. They allow users
to work alone or in small groups, work offline, or work on experimental changes
over an extended period without losing the benefits of version control. These
characteristics facilitate collaborative work. Moreover, a distributed VCS can
be used in a centralized way, where one copy of the repository is treated as
the final authority on the repository's history. This gives users the best of
both worlds, by allowing some to sync directly with each other while others
sync with this authoritative copy.

Today, a distributed VCS, [Git][], is the most popular VCS. Some polls estimate
that it's used by more than 90% of all developers. A few other version control
systems in use today include Mercurial, Subversion, Perforce, and Plastic SCM.
Many document editors, such as Google Docs and Microsoft Word, also have
built-in version control systems. Each of these systems offers a twist on
version control, differing sometimes in the area of user functionality,
sometimes in how they handle things on the back-end, and sometimes both. In
this reader, we'll focus on Git.

### First-time Git Configuration

When you save changes to a repository, Git will automatically annotate the
changes with your name and email. In collaborative projects, these annotations
are important for determining who made which changes. Thus the first time you
use Git, you need to set your name and email.

:::{tip}
All Git commands begin with `git` and the name of a subcommand.

You can view the documentation for any subcommand by adding `--help` to the
end. For instance, to get help with the `git config` subcommand used in the
next example, run `git config --help`.
:::

To set your name, open a terminal and type:

```sh
git config --global user.name "YOUR_NAME"
```

Replace `YOUR_NAME` with your name or preferred alias. Then press `Enter`. To
set your email, enter:

```sh
git config --global user.email "YOUR_EMAIL"
```

Replace `YOUR_EMAIL` with your preferred public email address. Git is
open-source, community-developed software, so it won't share your email address
with spammers, but your email address *will* be visible on any changes you make
to public repositories.

:::{tip}
Many developers configure Git to use their real name. This can be beneficial
for ensuring you receive credit for any open-source or academic computing work
you do while building your career.

If you're not comfortable attaching your real name to work you do with Git, a
reasonable alternative is to use an alias you control, such as your GitHub
username. {numref}`sec-github` explains more about GitHub.

Likewise, if you don't want to attach your primary email address to work you do
with Git, set up a new email address and use that. Avoid making up a fake email
address, as this will make it impossible for people to contact you and might
even allow someone else to take credit for your work.
:::

You can run either of these commands again later to change the name and email
address with which Git annotates your work.

Finally, we suggest that you change the default branch name from `master` to
`main`. You'll learn more about what branches are later, but we advise making
this change now. For too long the computing industry has relied on offensive
terms like "master" and "slave" to describe technology, and changing such terms
is part of a [wider push][sfconservancy] to move away from the framework they
imply. This is a small change, but we at the DataLab believe that, in all
instances, language matters.

[sfconservancy]: https://sfconservancy.org/news/2020/jun/23/gitbranchname/

To make this change, run:

```sh
git config --global init.defaultBranch main
```


(sec-creating-a-repository)=
## Creating a Repository

Now that we've established what version control systems are, and you've
configured Git, it's time to create a repository.

Open a terminal and navigate to your home directory:

```sh
cd
```

To **initialize** a repository called `my_first_repository`, enter:

```sh
git init my_first_repository
```

Git will reply with a message like:

```
Initialized empty Git repository in /home/USERNAME/my_first_repository/.git/
```

When you run the `git init` command, Git first checks whether the specified
directory (`my_first_repository/`) exists, and creates it if it doesn't. Then
Git makes the directory a repository by creating a hidden `.git/` subdirectory.
This subdirectory is where Git will store the history of the repository.

:::{warning}
The `.git/` subdirectory is hidden for a reason: generally, you should let Git
manage its contents. Avoid creating or modifying files and directories inside
`.git/`, as this might break your repository. If you delete `.git/`, your
repository will no longer be a repository---it will just be an ordinary
directory.
:::

:::{tip}
How many repositories to create is up to you, and depends on how you like to
work, but we recommend that you create a separate repository for each distinct
project.
:::

Now let's check that Git actually recognizes `my_first_repository/` as a
repository. First, navigate to the directory:

```sh
cd my_first_repository/
```

You can use `git status` to check the status of a repository. Try running it
for the new repository:

```sh
git status
```

Since the directory is a repository, Git will respond with output like:

```
On branch main

No commits yet

nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)
```

We'll save branches for a different lesson. Skipping to the second part of the
message, Git says that there are no "commits" yet. A **commit** is a saved
snapshot (or version) of the repository. You'll learn how to make a commit
soon, but right now, it makes sense that there are no commits yet, since you
just created the repository. Finally, in the third part of the message, Git
says that there is nothing to commit. This also makes sense, since we haven't
created any files in the repository yet.

:::{note}
When Git doesn't recognize a directory as a repository, the output from `git
status` instead looks like:

```
fatal: not a git repository
```
:::


(sec-adding-committing-changes)=
## Adding & Committing Changes

Let's create a new file in the repository called `hello.txt`. Open a text
editor (like `nano` or `vim`), enter the following text, and save it as
`hello.txt`:

```
Hello world!
```

Now check the status of the repository again:

```sh
git status
```

```
On branch main

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        hello.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

Git notices the new file, `hello.txt`, and says it's **untracked**, which means
Git doesn't have any history for the file. You just created the file and
haven't committed it yet, so it makes sense that there's no history.

Let's commit `hello.txt` now. The first step is to add the file to Git's
**staging area** (or **index**). The staging area is a virtual space for
preparing commits, where you can select which files or changes to include in
the commit. It might help to imagine the staging area as a box ðŸ“¦ that you're
packing up to store or to send to a friend. The `git add` command adds a file
or set of changes to the box.

:::{tip}
Putting distinct work in distinct commits makes it easier to inspect (and
occasionally undo) the work. Use `git add` (and its inverse, `git restore
--staged` or `git reset --`) to curate the contents of your commits.
:::

Go ahead and add `hello.txt` to the staging area:

```sh
git add hello.txt
```

Now check the status of the repository again:

```sh
git status
```

```
On branch main

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   hello.txt
```

Now Git reports that `hello.txt` is in the staging area and ready to be
committed.

You can make a commit with the `git commit` command. Enter the command:

```
git commit
```

In response, Git will open a text editor (typically `vim`) with the following
text:

```

# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.
#
# On branch main
#
# Initial commit
#
# Changes to be committed:
#   new file:   hello.txt
#
```

Git will then wait for you to write a **commit message**, a description of what
the commit changes, at the beginning of the text. The first line of the commit
message must be a summary of the commit in 72 characters or less. You can also
optionally follow this with a blank second line and then a longer description
of the commit beginning on the third line.

:::{note}
Conventionally, the first line of a commit message should be 50 characters or
less, a complete sentence, and written in the imperative mood. For example:

```
Fix typos in the main text.
```

Following conventions makes it easier for others to understand your work, but
there are occasionally situations where doing something else is justified. The
best approach is to talk to your collaborators about specific conventions they
want to follow, and check in with them about exceptions to the conventions.
:::

Edit the first line of the text to look like this:

```
Add first file.
# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.
#
# On branch main
#
# Initial commit
#
# Changes to be committed:
#   new file:   hello.txt
#
```

Finally, you can let Git know that you're done writing the commit message by
saving the text and exiting the text editor.

:::{admonition} Using Vim
:class: note, dropdown
In Vim, press `i` to enter insert mode and type the commit message.

When you're finished, press `Esc` to return to normal mode, type `:wq` (the
command to write and quit), and press `Enter`.

If you want to cancel the commit instead, press `Esc` to return to normal mode,
type `:q!` (the command to quit without saving), and press `Enter`.
:::

:::{tip}
If you exit the text editor without saving, Git will cancel the commit.
:::

Git will print some output to confirm that the commit was created:

```
[main (root-commit) 0f5c79d] Add first file.
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 hello.txt
```

Important details in the output include:

* A **hash** that uniquely identifies the commit (`0f5c79d` above, but yours
  will be different)
* The commit message
* The number of files changed
* A list of which files were changed (`hello.txt` in this case)

Run `git status` to see how the output has changed now that you've made a
commit:

```sh
git status
```

```
On branch main
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

Git reports that there's nothing to commit, and that the "working tree" is
clean. The **working tree** consists of the files and directories you actually
have in your repository. The working tree is **clean** if it's identical to the
most recent commit, meaning you haven't changed anything since that commit.

To get more practice making commits, suppose we want to move the file
`hello.txt` to `README.md`, since `README.md` is conventionally the first file
people read when they start working with an unfamiliar repository. Use the `mv`
shell command to move the file:

```sh
mv hello.txt README.md
```

Now check the status of the repository:

```sh
git status
```

```
On branch main
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add/rm <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        deleted:    hello.txt

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        README.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

Git notices that `hello.txt` is gone, and also that there's a new file
`README.md`. Since `README.md` is untracked, Git doesn't recognize that it's
the same file as the old `hello.txt`. Go ahead and add the changes to
`README.md` to the staging area:

```sh
git add README.md
```

Add the changes to `hello.txt` as well:

```sh
git add hello.txt
```

It might seem counterintuitive to add `hello.txt`, since it no longer exists.
What you should keep in mind is that `git add` adds *changes* to the staging
area, *not files,* and moving (or removing) a file is a change to that file.

:::{important}
Removing/deleting a file is a change to that file, just like creating, editing,
or moving the file.

If you want to delete a file called `FILE` from a repository, first delete the
file, then run `git add FILE` to add the change to the staging area, and
finally run `git commit` to make a commit.

Note that deleted files remain in the repository's history, so it's possible to
restore them later.
:::

Now check the status:

```sh
git status
```

```
On branch main
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        renamed:    hello.txt -> README.md
```

After adding the changes to both files, Git correctly recognizes that the file
was moved/renamed. Go ahead and commit the change with the commit message
`Move hello.txt to README.md.`:

```sh
git commit
```

```
[main 4f57023] Move hello.txt to README.md.
 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 rename hello.txt => README.md (100%)
```

If you check the status now, you'll see that the working tree is once again
clean.

:::{important}
Remember, saving your work in Git is a two step process:

1. `git add` (for each file with changes you want to save)
2. `git commit`

It's also usually a good idea to run `git status` (and `git diff`, which we'll
see later) before `git commit` to check that you've added the changes you meant
to add to the staging area.
:::

:::{tip}
You can also make commits without opening a text editor. Use this command:

```sh
git commit -m "COMMIT_MESSAGE"
```

Replace `COMMIT_MESSAGE` with your commit message. You can't provide a detailed
description when you commit this way, so it's only appropriate for small,
simple commits.
:::


## Exploring & Restoring History

Now that you've made some commits, let's take a look at the repository's
history. To view the history of commits to a repository, enter the command:

```sh
git log
```

```
commit 4f5702364c155faa260080671b63177550347ea0 (HEAD -> main)
Author: YOUR_NAME <YOUR_EMAIL>
Date:   Wed Jan 8 14:32:21 2025 -0800

    Move hello.txt to README.md.

commit 0f5c79d0494763a31ade6a2514dd389f3f1eb1b4
Author: YOUR_EMAIL <YOUR_EMAIL>
Date:   Wed Jan 8 13:59:08 2025 -0800

    Add first file.

```

For each commit, the log lists the hash, name and email of the author, the
timestamp, and commit message.

:::{note}
When a repository has a long history, `git log` will display the commits in a
scrolling window. You can use the up and down arrow keys to scroll, and type
`q` (for quit) to return to the terminal.
:::

Let's make one more commit: we'll add a title to the `README.md` file. Open the
file with a text editor and edit it so that the contents are:

```
# My README

Hello world!
```

When you're finished, save the file. As usual, Git notices that something in
the repository has changed:

```sh
git status
```

```
On branch main
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   README.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

You can view the difference, or **diff** between the working tree and the most
recent commit with `git diff`:

```sh
git diff
```

```
diff --git a/README.md b/README.md
index cd08755..4e3eb18 100644
--- a/README.md
+++ b/README.md
@@ -1 +1,3 @@
+# My README
+
 Hello world!

```

The `git diff` command prints a diff for each file that's been changed. In each
diff, lines added since the last commit are prefixed with `+`, while lines
removed since the last commit are prefixed with `-`. For context, each diff
usually also includes a few lines that didn't change (no prefix). It's a good
idea to check `git diff` before adding files to the staging area, so that you
know what you're adding.

:::{tip}
If you've changed a lot of files, the output from `git diff` can be
overwhelming. You can use the command `git diff PATH` to view only the changes
to the file or directory at `PATH`.

You can also use `git diff --staged` to see the difference between files in the
staging area and the last commit.

There are many other ways to use `git diff`; check the documentation (`git diff
--help`) to learn more.
:::

Add and commit the changes. After you finish, you should have a third commit in
the repository history (`git log`) that looks something like this:

```
commit e15d8c1355f16c26fe00354855c24bff3626fc1b (HEAD -> main)
Author: YOUR_NAME <YOUR_EMAIL>
Date:   Wed Jan 8 15:35:02 2025 -0800

    Add title.

```

Now suppose you decide you don't like the new title in `README.md`. If you want
to change the title to something new, the best approach is to edit the file and
make a new commit. On the other hand, if you want to restore an earlier version
of the file, manual editing is tedious and error-prone.

Instead, you can use the `git restore --source` command to restore a file to
how it was in a particular commit.

To demonstrate this, let's restore `README.md` to how it was in the commit
before we added a title. First check `git log` to get the commit's hash:

```
commit e15d8c1355f16c26fe00354855c24bff3626fc1b (HEAD -> main)
Author: YOUR_NAME <YOUR_EMAIL>
Date:   Wed Jan 8 15:35:02 2025 -0800

    Add title.

commit 4f5702364c155faa260080671b63177550347ea0
Author: YOUR_NAME <YOUR_EMAIL>
Date:   Wed Jan 8 14:32:21 2025 -0800

    Move hello.txt to README.md.

commit 0f5c79d0494763a31ade6a2514dd389f3f1eb1b4
Author: YOUR_NAME <YOUR_EMAIL>
Date:   Wed Jan 8 13:59:08 2025 -0800

    Add first file.

```

In this example, the hash begins `4f5702`, but it will be different for your
commit.

:::{tip}
As you can see from `git log`, the full hash for each commit is quite long. For
most Git commands that require a hash, you can just use the first 5-6 digits.
Git will let you know if it needs more digits to disambiguate which commit you
mean.
:::

To restore `README.md` to how it was in commit `4f5702`, run:

```
git restore --source 4f5702 README.md
```

Make sure to replace `4f5702` with the actual hash for your commit.

After running the command, take a look at `README.md` with your text editor.
You should see that it no longer has the title. And if you look at the status
of the repository, you'll see that Git noticed the change:

```sh
git status
```

```
On branch main
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   README.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

As with any other change, you can add and commit this change if you want to
save it in the repository's history.

:::{warning}
Be careful with `git restore`: when you restore a file, any *uncommitted*
changes you've made to the file will be erased, and there's no undo.

If you just want to see what a file looked like in a previous commit, use `git
show HASH:FILE` instead, where `HASH` is the commit's hash and `FILE` is the
path to the file.
:::

:::{note}
There are many other ways to use `git restore`. For instance, you can use `git
restore --staged FILE` to remove a file from the staging area. To learn more,
check the documentation (`git restore --help`).
:::

:::{tip}
If you want to revert/undo an entire commit, use `git revert` rather than `git
restore`. Specifically, run:

```sh
git revert HASH
```

Replace `HASH` with the hash of the commit you want to revert.

Git reverts a commit by creating a new commit, called a **revert commit**, with
changes exactly the opposite of the original: lines that were added get removed
and lines that were removed get added. Because of this, Git will prompt you for
a commit message when you run `git revert`; it's fine to use the default
message.
:::

<!--- TODO
The command to revert a commit is `git revert`. Generally, you should also
provide the command with the hash of the commit you want to revert.

To revert the commit that added the title, run:

```sh
git revert e15d8c
```

Don't forget to replace `e15d8c` with the hash for the commit you made (you can
find this in `git log`). Git reverts a commit by creating a new commit, called
a **revert commit**, with changes exactly the opposite of the original: lines
that were added get removed and lines that were removed get added. When you run
`git revert`, Git creates the revert commit and then opens a text editor for a
commit message as usual. In this case, however, Git also automatically fills in
the commit message:

```
Revert "Add title."

This reverts commit e15d8c1355f16c26fe00354855c24bff3626fc1b.

# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.
#
# On branch main
# Changes to be committed:
#	modified:   README.md
#
```

You can edit the commit message if you want, but it's also perfectly fine to
accept the default message. As usual, save and quit when you're finished. If
you inspect `README.md` with a text editor, you'll see that the title is gone,
and if you examine `git log`, you'll see that there are now four commits in the
repository's history.
