<p><strong>Version control</strong> describes the process of storing and organizing multiple
versions (or copies) of documents on your computer. Approaches to version
control range from simple to complex and they can involve the use of both
manual and automatic workflows. Ultimately, the overall goal of version control
is to store and manage multiple versions of the same document(s).</p>
<p>Chances are good that you are already doing some kind of version control
yourself. Most people have a folder/directory somewhere on their computer that
looks something like this:</p>
<p><img src="img/mac_finder_1.png" alt="A finder window of .docx files labeled with different versions" /></p>
<p>Or perhaps, this:</p>
<p><img src="img/mac_window_2.png" alt="A finder window of .docx files labeled with dates" /></p>
<p>This is a rudimentary form of version control that relies completely on a manual
workflow of saving multiple versions of a file. This system works minimally well,
in that it provides you with a history of file versions theoretically organized
by their time sequence. But this <strong>file system method</strong> offers no information
about how the file has changed from version to version, why you might have saved
a particular version, or specifically how the various versions are related. This
self-managed file system approach is more subject to error than software-assisted
version control systems; it is not uncommon for users to make mistakes when
naming file versions, or to go back and edit files out of sequence. Software-assisted
version control systems (VCS) such as Git were designed to solve this problem.</p>
</div>
<div id="software-assisted-version-control" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="2.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Software Assisted Version Control<a href="version-control.html#software-assisted-version-control" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Version control software has its roots in the software development community,
where it is common for many coders to work on the same file, sometimes
synchronously, amplifying the need to track and understand revisions. But
nearly all types of computer files, not just code, can be tracked using modern
version control systems. IBM’s OS/360 IEBUPDTE software update tool is widely
regarded as the earliest and most widely adopted precursor to modern, version
control systems. Its release in 1972 of the Source Code Control System (SCCS)
package marked the first, fully fledged system designed specifically for
software version control.</p>
<p>Today’s marketplace offers many options when it comes to choosing a version
control software system. They include systems such as Git, Visual Source Safe,
Subversion, Mercurial, CVS, and Plastic SCM, to name a few. Each of these
systems offers its twist on version control, differing sometimes in the area of
user functionality, sometimes in how it handles things on the back-end, and
sometimes both. This tutorial focuses on the Git VCS, but in the sections that
follow we offer some general information about classes of version control
systems to help you better understand how Git does what it does and to help you
make more informed decisions about how to deploy it for you own work.</p>
</div>
<div id="local-vs-server-based-version-control" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="2.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Local vs Server-based Version Control<a href="version-control.html#local-vs-server-based-version-control" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>There are two general types of version control systems: <strong>local</strong> and
<strong>server</strong> (sometimes called cloud) based systems. When working with a
<strong>local</strong> version control system, all files, metadata, and everything
associated with the version control system live on your local drive in a
universe unto itself. Working locally is a perfectly reasonable option for
those who work independently (not as part of a team), have no need to regularly
share their files or file versions, and who have robust back-up practices for
their local storage drive(s). Working locally is also sometimes the only option
for projects involving protected data and/or proprietary code that cannot be
shared.</p>
<p><strong>Server-based VCS</strong> utilize software running on your local computer that
communicates with a remote server (or servers) that store your files and data.
Depending on the system being deployed, files and data may reside exclusively
on the server and are downloaded to temporary local storage only when a file is
being actively edited. Or, the system may maintain continuous local and remote
versions of your files. Server-based systems facilitate team science because
they allow multiple users to have access to the same files, and all their
respective versions, via the server. They can also provide an important,
non-local back-up of your files, protecting you from loss of data should your
local storage fail.</p>
<p><strong>Git is a free server-based version control system that can store files both
locally and on a remote server.</strong> While the sections that follow offer a
broader description of server-based version control, in this workshop we will
focus only on using Git locally and will not configure the software to
communicate with, store files on, or otherwise interact with a remote server.
DataLab’s companion <a href="https://ucdavisdatalab.github.io/workshop_git_for_teams/">Git for Teams</a> workshop focuses on using Git with the
GitHub cloud service to capitalize on Git’s distributed version control
capabilities.</p>
<p>Server-based version control systems can generally be segmented into two
distinct categories: 1) Centralized Version Control Systems (Centralized VCS)
and 2) Distributed Version Control Systems (Distributed VCS).</p>
</div>
<div id="central-version-control-systems" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="2.4">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Central Version Control Systems<a href="version-control.html#central-version-control-systems" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p><strong>Centralized VCS</strong> is the oldest and the predominant form of version control
architecture worldwide. Centralized VCS implement a “spoke and wheel”
architecture to provided server-based version control.</p>
<p><img src="img/spoke_and_where_cloud.png" alt="Spoke and wheel diagram showing computers connected to a central cloud" /></p>
<p>With the spoke and wheel architecture, the server maintains a centralized
collection of file versions. Users utilize version control clients to
“check-out” a file of interest to their local file storage, where they are free
to make changes to the file. Centralized VCS typically restrict other users
from checking out editable versions of a file if another user currently has the
file checked out. Once the user who has checked out the file has finished
making changes, they “check-in” their new version, which is then stored on the
server from where it can be retrieved and “checked-out” by another user. Taken
together, centralized VCS provide a very controlled and ordered universe that
ensures file integrity and tracking of changes. However, this regulation comes
at a cost: namely, it it reduces the ease with which multiple users can work
simultaneously on the same file.</p>
</div>
<div id="distributed-version-control-systems" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="2.5">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.5</span> Distributed Version Control Systems<a href="version-control.html#distributed-version-control-systems" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p><strong>Distributed VCS</strong> are not dependent on a central repository as a means of
sharing files or tracking versions. Distributed VCS implement a network
architecture (as opposed to the spoke and wheel of the centralized VCS as
pictured above) to allow each user to communicate directly with every other
user.</p>
<p><img src="img/distributed_network.png" alt="Distributed VCS showing computers connected to each other" /></p>
<p>In distributed VCS, each user maintains their own version history of the files
being tracked, and the VCS software communicates between users to keep the
various local file systems in sync with each other. With this type of system,
the local versions of two different users will diverge from each other if both
users make changes to the file. This divergence will remain in place until the
local repositories are synced, at which time the VCS stitches (or <strong>merges</strong>)
the two different versions of the file into a single version that reflects the
changes made by each individual, and then saves the stitched version of the
file onto both systems as the current version. Various mechanisms can then be
used to resolve the conflicts that may arise during this merge process.
Distributed VCS offer greater flexibility and facilitate collaborative work,
but a lack of understanding of the sync/merge workflow can cause problems. It
is not uncommon for a user to forget to sync their local repository with the
repositories of other team members and, as a result, work for extended periods
of time on outdated files that don’t reflect their teammates and result in work
inefficiencies and merge challenges.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-best-of-both-worlds" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="2.6">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.6</span> The Best of Both Worlds<a href="version-control.html#the-best-of-both-worlds" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>An important feature of distributed VCS is that many users and organizations
choose to include a central server as a node in the distributed network. This
creates an hybrid universe in which some users will sync directly to each other
while other users will sync through a central server.</p>
<p><img src="img/hybrid_network.png" alt="A hybrid diagram of spoke and wheel VCS and distributed VCS" /></p>
<p>Syncing with a cloud-based server provides an extra level of backup for your
files and also facilitates communication between users. But treating the server
as just another node on the network (as opposed to a centralized point of
control) puts the control and flexibility back in the hands of the individual
developer. For example, in a true centralized VCS, if the server goes down
then nobody can check files in and out of the server, which means that nobody
can work. But in a distributed VCS this is not an issue. Users can continue to
work on local versions and the system will sync any changes when the server
becomes available. <strong>Git, the focus of this tutorial, is a Distributed VCS.</strong>
You can use Git to share and sync repositories directly with other users or
through a central Git server such as GitHub or GitLab.</p>
</div>
<div id="how-vcs-manage-your-files" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="2.7">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.7</span> How VCS Manage Your Files<a href="version-control.html#how-vcs-manage-your-files" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Most users think about version control as a process of managing files. For
example, you might have a directory called <code>My Project</code> that holds several
files related to this project as follows:</p>
<p><img src="img/mac_finder_3.png" alt="A finder window with different files related to a project" /></p>
<p>One approach to managing changes to the above project files would be to store
multiple versions of each file as in the figure below for the file
<code>analysis.r</code>:</p>
<p><img src="img/version_tree.png" alt="Diagram of analysis.r in a working directory referenced to its versions" /></p>
<p>In fact, many VCS do exactly this. They treat each file as the minimum unit of
data and simply save various versions of each file along with some additional
information about the version. This approach can work reasonably well. However,
it has limitations. First, this approach can unnecessarily consume space on the
local storage device, especially if you are saving many versions of a very
large file. It also has difficulty dealing with changes in file names,
typically treating the same file with a new name as a completely new file,
thereby breaking the chain of version history.</p>
<p><strong>To combat these issues, good VCS don’t actually manage files at all. They
manage directories.</strong> Distributed VCS like Git take this alternate approach to
data storage that is directory, rather than file, based.</p>
</div>
<div id="graph-based-data-management" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="2.8">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.8</span> Graph-Based Data Management<a href="version-control.html#graph-based-data-management" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Git (and many other distributed VCS) manage your files as collections of data
rather than collections of files. Git’s primary unit of management is the
<strong>repository,</strong> or <strong>repo</strong> for short, which is aligned with your computer’s
directory/folder structure. Consider, for example, the following file
structure:</p>
<p><img src="img/TT_tree_mobile.jpg" alt="A hierarchical file tree with files and subdirectories" /></p>
<p>Here we see a user, Tom’s, home directory, which contains three sub directories
(<code>Data</code>, <code>Thesis</code>, and <code>Tools</code>) and one file (<code>Notes.txt</code>). Both the <code>Data</code> and
<code>Tools</code> directories contain sub files and/or directories. If Tom wanted to
track changes to the two files in the <code>Data</code> directory, he would first create a
Git repository by placing the Data directory <strong>under version control.</strong></p>
<p>When a repository is created, the Git system writes a collection of <em>hidden
files</em> into the data directory that it uses to store information about all of
the data that lives under that directory. This includes information about the
addition, renaming, and deletion of both files and folders as well as
information about changes to the data contained in the files themselves.
Additions, deletions and versions of files are tracked and stored not as copies
of files, but rather as a set of instructions that describes changes made to
the underling data and the directory structure that describes them.</p>
