Git Setup
=========

If you're using Git for the first time, you'll need to set a username and password. You'll do this
on the command line. To check whether a username and password have already been set, enter

```
$ git config --global user.name
```

for your username, and 

```
$ git config --global user.email
```

for your email.

If these commands return information, you're good to go. If they don't, you can use

```
$ git config --global user.name "YOUR NAME"
```

to set your username, and

```
$ git config --global user.email "YOUR EMAIL"
```

to set your email.
