# References

The [Git Book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) is the definitive Git resource
and provides an excellent reference for everything that we will cover in the
interactive session. There is no need to read the book prior to the session,
but it's a good reference resource to have available as you begin to work with
Git after the workshop.
