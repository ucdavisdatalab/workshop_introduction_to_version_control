# Version Control

## What is Version Control?

**Version control** describes a process of storing and organizing multiple versions 
(or copies) of documents that you create. Approaches to version control range 
from simple to complex and can involve the use of various human workflows and/or 
software applications to accomplish the overall goal of storing and managing 
multiple versions of the same document(s). 

Most people have a folder/directory somewhere on their computer that looks 
something like this:

![](`r url`)

Or perhaps, this:

![](`r url2`)

This is a rudimentary form of version control that relies completely on the human 
workflow of saving multiple versions of a file. This system works minimally well, 
in that it provides you with a history of file versions theoretically organized 
by their time sequence. But this **file system method** offers no information 
about how the file has changed from version to version, why you might have saved 
a particular version, or specifically how the various versions are related. This 
human-managed file system approach is more subject to error than software-assisted 
version control systems; it is not uncommon for users to make mistakes when 
naming file versions, or to go back and edit files out of sequence. Software-assisted 
version control systems (VCS) such as Git were designed to solve this problem.

## Software Assisted Version Control

Version control software has its roots in the software development community, where 
it is common for many coders to work on the same file, sometimes synchronously, 
amplifying the need to track and understand revisions. But nearly all types of 
computer files, not just code, can be tracked using modern version control systems. 
IBM's OS/360 IEBUPDTE software update tool is widely regarded as the earliest 
and most widely adopted precursor to modern, version control systems. Its 
release in 1972 of the Source Code Control System (SCCS) package marked the 
first, fully fledged system designed specifically for software version control. 

Today's marketplace offers many options when it comes to choosing a version 
control software system. They include systems such as Git, Visual Source Safe, 
Subversion, Mercurial, CVS, and Plastic SCM, to name a few. Each of these systems 
offers its twist on version control, differing sometimes in the area of user 
functionality, sometimes in how it handles things on the back-end, and sometimes 
both. This tutorial focuses on the Git VCS, but in the sections that follow we 
offer some general information about classes of version control systems to help 
you better understand how Git does what it does and to help you make more informed 
decisions about how to deploy it for you own work.

## Local vs Server-based Version Control

There are two general types of version control systems: **local** and **server** 
(sometimes called cloud) based systems. When working with a **local** version 
control system, all files, metadata, and everything associated with the version 
control system live on your local drive in a universe unto itself. Working locally 
is a perfectly reasonable option for those who work independently (not as part of 
a team), have no need to regularly share their files or file versions, and who 
have robust back-up practices for their local storage drive(s). Working locally 
is also sometimes the only option for projects involving protected data and/or 
proprietary code that cannot be shared. 

**Server-based VCS** utilize software running on your local computer that 
communicates with a remote server (or servers) that store your files and data.
Depending on the system being deployed, files and data may reside exclusively 
on the server and are downloaded to temporary local storage only when a file is 
being actively edited. Or, the system may maintain continuous local and remote 
versions of your files. Server-based systems facilitate team science because 
they allow multiple users to have access to the same files, and all their 
respective versions, via the server. They can also provide an important, non-local 
back-up of your files, protecting you from loss of data should your local 
storage fail. 

**Git is a free server-based version control system that can store files both **
**locally and on a remote server.** While the sections that follow offer a broader 
description of server-based version control, in this workshop we will focus only 
on using Git locally and will not configure the software to communicate with, 
store files on, or otherwise interact with a remote server. DataLab's companion 
[Git for Teams] workshop focuses on using Git with the GitHub cloud service to 
capitalize on Git's distributed version control capabilities.

Server-based version control systems can generally be segmented into two 
distinct categories: 1) Centralized Version Control Systems (Centralized VCS) 
and 2) Distributed Version Control Systems (Distributed VCS). 

## How VCS Manage Your Files

Most users think about version control as a process of managing files. For 
example, if I might have a directory called `My Project` that holds several files 
related to this project as follows: 

![](`r url9`)

One approach to managing changes to the above project files would be to store 
multiple versions of each file as in the figure below for the file analysis.r:

![](`r url10`)

In fact, many VCS do exactly this. They treat each file as the minimum unit of 
data and simply save various versions of each file along with some additional 
information about the version. This approach can work reasonably well. However, 
it has limitations. First, this approach can unnecessarily consume space on the 
local storage device, especially if you are saving many versions of a very large 
file. It also has difficulty dealing with changes in file names, typically 
treating the same file with a new name as a completely new file, thereby breaking 
the chain of version history.

**To combat these issues, good VCS don't actually manage files at all. They **
**manage directories.** Distributed VCS like Git take this alternate approach 
to data storage that is directory, rather than file, based.  

## Graph-Based Data Management

Git (and many other distributed VCS) manage your files as collections of data 
rather than collections of files. Git's primary unit of management is the 
**repository,** or **repo** for short, which is aligned with your computer's 
directory/folder structure. Consider, for example, the following file structure:

![](`r url11`)

Here we see a user, Tom's, home directory, which contains three sub directories 
(`Data`, `Thesis`, and `Tools`) and one file (`Notes.txt`). Both the `Data` and 
`Tools` directories contain sub files and/or directories. If Tom wanted to track 
changes to the two files in the `Data` directory, he would first create a Git 
repository by placing the Data directory **under version control.** 

When a repository is created, the Git system writes a collection of *hidden files* 
into the data directory that it uses to store information about all of the data 
that lives under that directory. This includes information about the addition, 
renaming, and deletion of both files and folders as well as information about 
changes to the data contained in the files themselves. Additions, deletions and 
versions of files are tracked and stored not as copies of files, but rather as a 
set of instructions that describes changes made to the underling data and the 
directory structure that describes them.
