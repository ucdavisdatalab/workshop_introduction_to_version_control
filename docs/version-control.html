<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> What is Version Control?</h2>
<p><strong>Version control</strong> describes a process of storing and organizing multiple versions
(or copies) of documents that you create. Approaches to version control range
from simple to complex and can involve the use of various human workflows and/or
software applications to accomplish the overall goal of storing and managing
multiple versions of the same document(s).</p>
<p>Most people have a folder/directory somewhere on their computer that looks
something like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://datalab.ucdavis.edu/cstahmer/git_workshop_images/mac_finder_1.png" /></p>
<p>Or perhaps, this:</p>
<p><img src="https://datalab.ucdavis.edu/cstahmer/git_workshop_images/mac_window_2.png" /></p>
<p>This is a rudimentary form of version control that relies completely on the human
workflow of saving multiple versions of a file. This system works minimally well,
in that it provides you with a history of file versions theoretically organized
by their time sequence. But this <strong>file system method</strong> offers no information
about how the file has changed from version to version, why you might have saved
a particular version, or specifically how the various versions are related. This
human-managed file system approach is more subject to error than software-assisted
version control systems; it is not uncommon for users to make mistakes when
naming file versions, or to go back and edit files out of sequence. Software-assisted
version control systems (VCS) such as Git were designed to solve this problem.</p>
</div>
<div id="software-assisted-version-control" class="section level2" number="2.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Software Assisted Version Control</h2>
<p>Version control software has its roots in the software development community, where
it is common for many coders to work on the same file, sometimes synchronously,
amplifying the need to track and understand revisions. But nearly all types of
computer files, not just code, can be tracked using modern version control systems.
IBM’s OS/360 IEBUPDTE software update tool is widely regarded as the earliest
and most widely adopted precursor to modern, version control systems. Its
release in 1972 of the Source Code Control System (SCCS) package marked the
first, fully fledged system designed specifically for software version control.</p>
<p>Today’s marketplace offers many options when it comes to choosing a version
control software system. They include systems such as Git, Visual Source Safe,
Subversion, Mercurial, CVS, and Plastic SCM, to name a few. Each of these systems
offers its twist on version control, differing sometimes in the area of user
functionality, sometimes in how it handles things on the back-end, and sometimes
both. This tutorial focuses on the Git VCS, but in the sections that follow we
offer some general information about classes of version control systems to help
you better understand how Git does what it does and to help you make more informed
decisions about how to deploy it for you own work.</p>
</div>
<div id="local-vs-server-based-version-control" class="section level2" number="2.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Local vs Server-based Version Control</h2>
<p>There are two general types of version control systems: <strong>local</strong> and <strong>server</strong>
(sometimes called cloud) based systems. When working with a <strong>local</strong> version
control system, all files, metadata, and everything associated with the version
control system live on your local drive in a universe unto itself. Working locally
is a perfectly reasonable option for those who work independently (not as part of
a team), have no need to regularly share their files or file versions, and who
have robust back-up practices for their local storage drive(s). Working locally
is also sometimes the only option for projects involving protected data and/or
proprietary code that cannot be shared.</p>
<p><strong>Server-based VCS</strong> utilize software running on your local computer that
communicates with a remote server (or servers) that store your files and data.
Depending on the system being deployed, files and data may reside exclusively
on the server and are downloaded to temporary local storage only when a file is
being actively edited. Or, the system may maintain continuous local and remote
versions of your files. Server-based systems facilitate team science because
they allow multiple users to have access to the same files, and all their
respective versions, via the server. They can also provide an important, non-local
back-up of your files, protecting you from loss of data should your local
storage fail.</p>
<p><strong>Git is a free server-based version control system that can store files both </strong>
<strong>locally and on a remote server.</strong> While the sections that follow offer a broader
description of server-based version control, in this workshop we will focus only
on using Git locally and will not configure the software to communicate with,
store files on, or otherwise interact with a remote server. DataLab’s companion
<a href="https://ucdavisdatalab.github.io/workshop_git_for_teams/">Git for Teams</a> workshop focuses on using Git with the GitHub cloud service to
capitalize on Git’s distributed version control capabilities.</p>
<p>Server-based version control systems can generally be segmented into two
distinct categories: 1) Centralized Version Control Systems (Centralized VCS)
and 2) Distributed Version Control Systems (Distributed VCS).</p>
</div>
<div id="central-version-control-systems" class="section level2" number="2.4">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Central Version Control Systems</h2>
<p><strong>Centralized VCS</strong> is the oldest and the predominant form of version control
architecture worldwide. Centralized VCS implement a “spoke and wheel” architecture
to provided server-based version control.</p>
<p><img src="https://datalab.ucdavis.edu/cstahmer/git_workshop_images/spoke_and_where_cloud.png" /></p>
<p>With the spoke and wheel architecture, the server maintains a centralized
collection of file versions. Users utilize version control clients to “check-out”
a file of interest to their local file storage, where they are free to make changes
to the file. Centralized VCS typically restrict other users from checking out
editable versions of a file if another user currently has the file checked out.
Once the user who has checked out the file has finished making changes, they
“check-in” their new version, which is then stored on the server from where it
can be retrieved and “checked-out” by another user. Taken together, centralized
VCS provide a very controlled and ordered universe that ensures file integrity
and tracking of changes. However, this regulation comes at a cost: namely, it
it reduces the ease with which multiple users can work simultaneously on the
same file.</p>
</div>
<div id="distributed-version-control-systems" class="section level2" number="2.5">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.5</span> Distributed Version Control Systems</h2>
<p><strong>Distributed VCS</strong> are not dependent on a central repository as a means of sharing
files or tracking versions. Distributed VCS implement a network architecture (as
opposed to the spoke and wheel of the centralized VCS as pictured above) to allow
each user to communicate directly with every other user.</p>
<p><img src="https://datalab.ucdavis.edu/cstahmer/git_workshop_images/distributed_network.png" /></p>
<p>In distributed VCS, each user maintains their own version history of the files
being tracked, and the VCS software communicates between users to keep the
various local file systems in sync with each other. With this type of system,
the local versions of two different users will diverge from each other if both
users make changes to the file. This divergence will remain in place until the
local repositories are synced, at which time the VCS stitches (or <strong>merges</strong>) the
two different versions of the file into a single version that reflects the
changes made by each individual, and then saves the stitched version of the file
onto both systems as the current version. Various mechanisms can then be used to
resolve the conflicts that may arise during this merge process. Distributed VCS
offer greater flexibility and facilitate collaborative work, but a lack of
understanding of the sync/merge workflow can cause problems. It is not uncommon
for a user to forget to sync their local repository with the repositories of
other team members and, as a result, work for extended periods of time on
outdated files that don’t reflect their teammates and result in work
inefficiencies and merge challenges.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-best-of-both-worlds" class="section level2" number="2.6">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.6</span> The Best of Both Worlds</h2>
<p>An important feature of distributed VCS is that many users and organizations
choose to include a central server as a node in the distributed network. This
creates an hybrid universe in which some users will sync directly to each other
while other users will sync through a central server.</p>
<p><img src="https://datalab.ucdavis.edu/cstahmer/git_workshop_images/hybrid_network.png" /></p>
<p>Syncing with a cloud-based server provides an extra level of backup for your
files and also facilitates communication between users. But treating the server
as just another node on the network (as opposed to a centralized point of control)
puts the control and flexibility back in the hands of the individual developer.
For example, in a true centralized VCS, if the server goes down then nobody can
check files in and out of the server, which means that nobody can work. But in a
distributed VCS this is not an issue. Users can continue to work on local versions
and the system will sync any changes when the server becomes available.
<strong>Git, the focus of this tutorial, is a Distributed VCS.</strong> You can use Git to
share and sync repositories directly with other users or through a central Git
server such as GitHub or GitLab.</p>
</div>
<div id="vcs-and-the-computer-file-system" class="section level2" number="2.7">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.7</span> VCS and the Computer File System</h2>
<p>When we think about version control, we typically think about managing changes to
individual files. From the user perspective, the <strong>file</strong> is typically the minimum
accessible unit of information. Whether working with images, tabular data, or
written text, we typically use software to open a file that contains the
information we want to view or edit. As such, it comes as a surprise to most users
that the concept of files, and their organizing containers (<strong>folders</strong> or
<strong>directories</strong>), are not intrinsic to how computers themselves store and
interact with data. In this section of the tutorial we will learn about how
computers store and access information and how VCS interact with this process
to track and manage files.</p>
</div>
<div id="how-computers-store-and-access-information" class="section level2" number="2.8">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.8</span> How Computers Store and Access Information</h2>
<p>For all of their computing power and seeming intelligence, computers still only
know two things: 0 and 1. In computer speak, we call this a <strong>binary system</strong>,
and the unit of memory on a hard-disk, flash drive, or computer chip that stores
each 1 or 0 is called a <strong>bit</strong>.You can think of your computer’s storage device
(regardless of what kind it is) as a presenting a large grid, where each box
is a bit:</p>
<p><img src="https://datalab.ucdavis.edu/cstahmer/git_workshop_images/empty_sectors.png" /></p>
<p>In the above example, as with most computer storage, the bits in our storage
grid are addressable, meaning that we can designate a particular bit using a row
and column number such as, for example, A7, or E12. Also, remember, that each
bit can only contain one of two values: 0 or 1. So, in practice, our storage grid
would actually look something like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://datalab.ucdavis.edu/cstahmer/git_workshop_images/filled_bits.png" /></p>
<p>All of the complex information that we store in the computer is translated to
this binary language prior to storage using a system called <strong>Unicode</strong>. You can
think of Unicode as a codebook that assigns a unique combination of 8, 16, 32, 64,
etc. (depending on how old your computer is) ones and zeros to each letter,
numeral, or symbol. For example, the 8-bit Unicode for the upper case letter “A”
is <code>01000001</code>, and the 8-bit Unicode character for the digit “3” is <code>00110011</code>.
The above grid actually spells out the phrase, “Call me Ishmael”, the opening
line of Herman Melville’s novel <em>Moby Dick</em>.</p>
<p>An important aspect of how computers story information in binary form is that,
unlike most human readable forms of data storage, there is no right to left, up
or down, or any other regularized organization of bits on a storage medium. When
you save a file on your computer, the computer simply looks for any open bits
and starts recording information. The net result is that the contents of single
file are frequently randomly interleaved with data from other files. This mode of
storage is used because it maximizes the use of open bits on the storage device.
But it presents the singular problem of not making data readable in a regularized,
linear fashion. To solve this problem, all computers reserve a particular part of
their internal memory for a <strong>directory</strong> that stores a sector map of all
chunks of data. For example, if you create a file called <code>README.txt</code> with the
word “hello” in it, the computer would randomly store the Unicode for the five
characters in the word “hello” on the storage device and make a directory entry
something like the following:</p>
<p><img src="https://datalab.ucdavis.edu/cstahmer/git_workshop_images/directory.png" /></p>
<p>Understanding the directory concept and how computers store information is
crucial to understanding how VCS mange your files.</p>
</div>
<div id="how-vcs-manage-your-files" class="section level2" number="2.9">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.9</span> How VCS Manage Your Files</h2>
<p>Most users think about version control as a process of managing files. For
example, if I might have a directory called <code>My Project</code> that holds several files
related to this project as follows:</p>
<p><img src="https://datalab.ucdavis.edu/cstahmer/git_workshop_images/mac_finder_3.png" /></p>
<p>One approach to managing changes to the above project files would be to store
multiple versions of each file as in the figure below for the file analysis.r:</p>
<p><img src="https://datalab.ucdavis.edu/cstahmer/git_workshop_images/version_tree.png" /></p>
<p>In fact, many VCS do exactly this. They treat each file as the minimum unit of
data and simply save various versions of each file along with some additional
information about the version. This approach can work reasonably well. However,
it has limitations. First, this approach can unnecessarily consume space on the
local storage device, especially if you are saving many versions of a very large
file. It also has difficulty dealing with changes in file names, typically
treating the same file with a new name as a completely new file, thereby breaking
the chain of version history.</p>
<p><strong>To combat these issues, good VCS don’t actually manage files at all. They </strong>
<strong>manage directories.</strong> Distributed VCS like Git take this alternate approach
to data storage that is directory, rather than file, based.</p>
</div>
<div id="graph-based-data-management" class="section level2" number="2.10">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.10</span> Graph-Based Data Management</h2>
<p>Git (and many other distributed VCS) manage your files as collections of data
rather than collections of files. Git’s primary unit of management is the
<strong>repository,</strong> or <strong>repo</strong> for short, which is aligned with your computer’s
directory/folder structure. Consider, for example, the following file structure:</p>

<p>Here we see a user, Tom’s, home directory, which contains three sub directories
(<code>Data</code>, <code>Thesis</code>, and <code>Tools</code>) and one file (<code>Notes.txt</code>). Both the <code>Data</code> and
<code>Tools</code> directories contain sub files and/or directories. If Tom wanted to track
changes to the two files in the <code>Data</code> directory, he would first create a Git
repository by placing the Data directory <strong>under version control.</strong></p>
<p>When a repository is created, the Git system writes a collection of <em>hidden files</em>
into the data directory that it uses to store information about all of the data
that lives under that directory. This includes information about the addition,
renaming, and deletion of both files and folders as well as information about
changes to the data contained in the files themselves. Additions, deletions and
versions of files are tracked and stored not as copies of files, but rather as a
set of instructions that describes changes made to the underling data and the
directory structure that describes them.</p>
